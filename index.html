<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>What is Copy Tiles: Keyboard?</h3>
<p>
    Copy Tiles is a text tile utility with a custom keyboard extension. Create reusable tiles (for example: email addresses,
    prompts, links, replies or notes), organise them into categories, and insert them quickly from the keyboard.
</p>

<h3>Do I need an account?</h3>
<p>
    No. Copy Tiles uses iCloud (CloudKit) to sync your tiles and settings across devices signed into the same Apple ID.
    There are no external accounts and no third-party servers.
</p>

<h3>How do I add the keyboard?</h3>
<p>
    On your iPhone or iPad, open <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Apps</strong> &gt; <strong>Copy Tiles</strong> &gt; <strong>Keyboards</strong>,
    then enable <strong>Copy Tiles</strong>.
</p>

<h3>Do I need “Allow Full Access”?</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Optional, but recommended:</strong> enabling <strong>Allow Full Access</strong> allows the keyboard extension to refresh iCloud sync
    and clipboard history directly from the keyboard.
</p>
<p>
    If you do not enable Full Access, iCloud sync still works when you open the main app.
</p>

<h3>How do categories work?</h3>
<p>
    Create unlimited categories to group your tiles. You can filter tiles by category in both the app and the keyboard.
</p>

<h3>Can I reorder tiles?</h3>
<p>
    Yes. You can drag and drop tiles to reorder them in the app. The tile order is synced and the keyboard shows the same order.
</p>

<h3>How do tile sizes work?</h3>
<p>
    You can choose Small, Medium or Large tile size. This controls how many tiles appear per row in the keyboard:
    Small = 4, Medium = 3, Large = 2.
</p>

<h3>How does clipboard history work?</h3>
<p>
    Copy Tiles can show recent clipboard content in the keyboard. Clipboard history is stored on-device and refreshes when the app
    or keyboard opens. Clipboard content is not synced via iCloud.
</p>

<h3>Does Copy Tiles collect any data?</h3>
<p>
    No analytics, no tracking, and no advertising SDKs.
    For full details, see our <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.
</p>

<h3>How do purchases work?</h3>
<p>
    Copy Tiles includes a 7-day free trial with full functionality. After the trial ends, you can unlock Lifetime Access with a
    one-time purchase. There are no subscriptions.
</p>

<h3>How do I restore my purchase?</h3>
<p>
    In the app, open Settings and tap <strong>Restore Purchases</strong>.
</p>

<h3>How do I report a bug?</h3>
<p>
    Please email details and reproduction steps to:<br>
    <strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:ferrraridave@icloud.com">ferrraridave@icloud.com</a>
</p>

<h3>What devices are supported?</h3>
<p>
    Copy Tiles supports iPhone and iPad running iOS/iPadOS 18.0 or later.
